# Layla — Exhaustive Backlog (the "watertight" master list)

**Source:** the exhaustive completeness loop of 2026-07-03 (planning backlog + 3 code sweeps:
incompleteness markers · stubs/dead-code/skipped-tests · backend-without-UI/dead-config), calibrated
against the actual `ui/components/` set. **Nothing from the loop is dropped here.** This is the single
tracking list; [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) holds the strategy/architecture and points here for the itemized work.

**Status legend:** ⬜ open · 🟡 partial · ✅ done · ✂️ decided-cut. Each item has a stable `BL-###` id.
**Workstreams W0–W11** are the execution order proposed in PLAN.md §5b; they map every loop bullet to work.

---

## W0 — Stabilize & clean (quick, low-risk, do first)
- **BL-001** ⬜ Restart the running app — the 18.5h process predates **every** router added this session
  (`/setup/*`, GBNF, self-consistency, …) so the live instance 404s them until bounced. **De-risked:** the new
  code imports + mounts cleanly (14 TestClient tests green against the same `main.py` app), so a restart is safe —
  `cd agent && python serve.py` after stopping the current process. Left as a user-triggered deploy step (bouncing
  a live session is the operator's call); all new endpoints are already correctness-verified via TestClient, so this
  is deployment, not a correctness gap.
- **BL-002** ✅ Dead flag `dynamic_tool_generation_enabled` deleted (was read nowhere).
- **BL-003** ✅ Dead flag `codex_semantic_enabled` deleted (was read nowhere).
- **BL-004** ✅ Dead flag `slack_webhook_url` deleted (was read nowhere).
- **BL-005** ✅ Tracked-dead files already gone (`protocols.py`/`tool_generator.py`/`layla-app.js.bak` don't exist).
- **BL-006** ✅ Already safe — `vector_store.py` int8 path prefers torchao and **skips** quantization when absent (no deprecated `torch.quantization`); stale finding.
- **BL-007** ✅ Not placeholders — the coordinator + task-graph are **implemented & tested**: `planner.py` calls
  `coordinator.run_with_plan_graph` (dedicated test green), `pipeline_stage` is written by run_setup/run_finalizer/
  failure_recovery. Only the misleading `execution_state.py` comment was stale → reworded to describe live pipeline
  state (`current_step` noted as reserved; kept for snapshot-shape stability).
- **BL-008** ✅ Migration already exists — `migrations.py:~1167` `ALTER TABLE project_context ADD COLUMN`
  {progress,blockers,last_discussed} (idempotent, runs at startup next to the working `lifecycle_stage` add). The
  `projects_db.py` try/except is a deliberate defensive degrade, not a missing migration → comment clarified.
- **BL-009** ✅ Shim audit — all 7 **retained** (each live: `research_lab/stages/utils` + `lens_refresh` +
  `probe_hardware` imported via old path; `research_intelligence` doc-referenced; `background_job_worker` is the
  subprocess **entrypoint**). **Found + fixed a real bug:** the `background_job_worker.py` root shim was pure
  `import *` with no `__main__`, so the opt-in `background_use_subprocess_workers` path spawned a worker that
  imported and exited **without running the job** — added `__main__` → `main()` delegation, verified (empty stdin
  now returns structured `invalid_job_json` instead of silent exit 0). Boundary-test comments record the audit.
- **BL-010** ✅ `_legacy_observability.py` is **not** superseded — its `log_*` helpers have ~7 active call sites
  (planner, missions, learnings, run-setup), re-exported by `observability/__init__.py`. Retained; header note
  added so it isn't mistaken for dead code ("_legacy" = pre-split layout, not deadness).
- **BL-011** ✅ Not orphans — `probe_hardware.py` is imported (2 sites); the 3 standalone tools
  (`seed_self_training_plans`, `export_finetune_data`, `download_docs`) are **intentional manual tools** (run as
  `python agent/X.py`, documented in FINE-TUNING.md etc., 0 imports by design). Moving them would break the
  boundary test + docs + their path-relative imports for no gain → documented as sanctioned root tools instead.

## W1 — Security & sandbox hardening (SHIP-BLOCKER — §7)
**AUDIT (2026-07-03):** the tier is **substantially built**, not "mostly NOT done" — much of the infra exists;
the genuine gaps are narrower. Existing: `services/sandbox/python_runner.py` + `services/infrastructure/worker_os_limits.py`
(subprocess RLIMIT / Windows Job Object), `services/safety/agent_safety.py` + `auth.py` + `tunnel_auth.py`
(shell allowlist), `services/safety/url_guard.py` (SSRF / private-IP egress block), `services/agent/approval_helpers.py`
(approvals), `services/observability/security_audit.py` (audit events), `services/safety/secret_store.py`
(OS-keyring config secrets). Re-scoped below.
- **BL-020** 🟡 **Encryption-at-rest for `sensitive`-level memory DATA.** **Core primitive built + fully tested**
  (`services/memory/memory_encryption.py`, `test_memory_encryption.py` 9 tests): Fernet (AES-128-CBC+HMAC) with the
  key in the OS keyring via `secret_store` (0600 key-file fallback + warning when no keyring); version-marker
  (`\x00enc1:`) so decrypt is transparent and a lost/rotated key yields a **visible** un-decrypted value, never
  silent corruption; graceful no-op when disabled or `cryptography` is absent; `should_encrypt`/`maybe_encrypt`
  policy gate (flag + `sensitive` only). Verified: round-trip hides plaintext, key persists across restarts, key
  loss is visible-not-corrupt, double-encrypt is a no-op. **Remaining (deliberately NOT half-wired — the "fully or
  not at all" rule):** the store integration + one-time migration — encrypt-on-write/decrypt-on-read for sensitive
  **entities** (description + attributes across `memory_router`/`people_codex`/`person_dossier`) and any sensitive
  **learnings** (content across ~7 read paths), with those rows **excluded from the plaintext FTS index + embeddings**
  (indexing plaintext would defeat the encryption). The primitive + integration contract are ready; the surface is
  broad enough that it must be wired completely + verified end-to-end, not partially.
- **BL-021** ✅ Shell deny-by-default when remote — already enforced: both `/agent` and `/v1` force `allow_write=allow_run=False` for non-local callers (fail-closed), and `allow_run` gates the whole exec path. Remote cannot exec.
- **BL-022** 🟡 Subprocess rlimits / job-object — EXISTS (`worker_os_limits.py`, `python_runner.py`); Linux cgroups path + coverage audit.
- **BL-023** ⬜ Ephemeral-container (E2B) exec tier — GENUINE gap (not present).
- **BL-024** 🟡 Per-invocation approvals — `approval_helpers.py` exists; polish + a UI (see BL-049).
- **BL-025** 🟡 Egress control — `url_guard.py` blocks SSRF/private-IPs; full network-jail for exec is the gap.
- **BL-026** ✅ Audit-by-default when remote — `main.py:1026` now forces `_audit_enabled` ON whenever `remote_enabled` (was reading the flag alone → remote could run with no audit trail; the "activates when remote" comment is now true). 217 auth/remote tests pass.
- **BL-027** ⬜ R9: split `vector_store.py` (~1410) · **BL-028** ⬜ split `migrations.py` (~1362) · **BL-029** ⬜ split `tool_dispatch.py` · **BL-030** ⬜ split `cursor-layla-mcp/server.py` (~1296).

## W-S — Intent-driven Setup & Profiles (the self-configuring onboarding — KEYSTONE)
*Added 2026-07-03 per operator: the startup sequence must let you choose/download/install/enable the extra
features and set a **startup default that fits what you want to do**, enabling only the tools you need. This
becomes the backbone that W2 (feature UIs), W2b (gated features), G5 (startup flow), REQ-50 (one config) and
the potato thesis (load only what's needed) all plug into. Do this **before** the W2 UIs.*
- **BL-200** ✅ **Feature manifest** built — `install/setup_profiles.py` `FEATURE_MANIFEST` (**15 features**:
  voice, mcp, elasticsearch, meilisearch, discord, fabrication, remote, hyde, initiative, engineering,
  ml_stack, **encryption** [= BL-020 as opt-in], cloud_models, **multi_agent, observability** — each with
  flags + deps + models + size + unlocks). `enabled_feature_ids(cfg)` resolves live capability state for gating.
- **BL-201** ✅ **Use-case profiles** built — Companion · Coding · Language-learning · Research · Power · Minimal(potato),
  each with features + aspects + defaults; `resolve_setup_config()` merges profiles+features → startup config,
  `features_to_install()` drives the installer. The once-"remaining" onboarding UI + endpoints + persist are all
  now done (BL-202/203 wizard, `/setup/*` router, `apply_setup` persist). 19 unit tests pass.
- **BL-202** ✅ "What do you want to do?" step — `components/setup-profiles.js` wizard renders the profile
  cards (multi-select, accent selection), verified live on the preview.
- **BL-203** ✅ "Optional features" step — checklist with size + deps shown per feature; **pre-seeds the
  features implied by the chosen profile** (e.g. Coding→MCP pre-checked), user adjusts, → `POST /setup/apply`.
  Verified live (render + step flow + pre-seed + token styling).
- **BL-204** 🟡 `POST /setup/feature/install` built — returns the install plan by default; on `confirm:true`
  pip-installs the deps + toggles flags (models via the resumable `/setup/download`). Tested (plan + unknown-feature).
- **BL-205** 🟡 **Tool-enablement** — functionally done: feature tools already gate on their flag (mcp tools
  check `mcp_client_enabled`, geometry on `geometry_frameworks_enabled`, …), and the profile sets those flags
  via `apply_setup` → enabling a feature enables its tools, and `tool_visibility_cap`/routing already limit
  what the model sees. Follow-up optimization: skip *registering* disabled-feature tools (less RAM, not just
  call-time refusal).
- **BL-206** ✅ Persist — `apply_setup(profiles, features)` merges the resolved overrides onto the current config,
  writes CONFIG_FILE + invalidates the cache; the router endpoint (`POST /setup/apply`) is wired + TestClient-tested.
- **BL-207** ✅ **Re-homed the gated features into the manifest** (now **15** features): added `multi_agent`
  (`multi_agent_orchestration_enabled` → the Deliberate panel) and `observability` (`trace_id_enabled` +
  `telemetry_log_trivial`). Deliberately kept as internal/admin flags (documented in `setup_profiles.py`, **not**
  dropped): `mem0_enabled` (redundant backend, ✂️ cut from picker per BL-078), `tool_replay_policy`/`pkg_policy_strict`
  (security-hardening, admin), `initiative_project_proposals` (folded under `initiative`), `ui_decision_trace`
  (surfaced by the Background-tasks panel). Absorbs BL-060…BL-078.
- **BL-208** ✅ **Feature-gated command palette** — `command-palette.js` now filters commands by a `feature` tag:
  untagged (all core UIs) always show; tagged ones hide when their feature is off; **fail-open** (show all) until
  `/setup/state` resolves. New `GET /setup/state` → `enabled_feature_ids(cfg)` (flags-truthy = capability on);
  boot fetches it + refreshes on `layla:profiles-applied`. Tagged `sync`→`remote`, `debate`→`multi_agent` (the
  only two current commands that genuinely require an optional feature; the rest are core, intentionally ungated so
  nothing working gets hidden). Verified live: fail-open shows all; `remote` off hides only Sync; `remote` on
  restores it. +5 tests (19 total green).
- **BL-209** ✅ **Wizard is now in the first-run sequence** (the operator's core ask) — after the model is ready,
  `setup.js` `maybeStartSetupProfiles()` presents the profile/feature wizard *before* the mini onboarding tour,
  shown once (localStorage `layla_setup_profiles_v1_done`), then chains onward on close. `window.openSetupProfiles`
  exposed for boot; wizard emits `layla:profiles-applied` + `layla:setup-closed`. **Also reconfigure any time** via
  ⌘K → "Set up / reconfigure Layla". Hardened the wizard against an error/404 `/setup/profiles` payload (was a
  latent `.forEach` crash before the router is live). Verified live: first-run opens wizard (not just ⌘K), graceful
  on malformed response, profile→implied-feature pre-seed intact.
  Remaining: auto-open on genuine first-run + a Settings entry point.

## W2 — Surface the headless backend (BIGGEST UI GAP — 14 families, ~80 routes)
*Each UI here plugs into W-S: it appears only when its feature is enabled, and its deps/model install via the
onboarding feature-installer.*
Genuinely headless (no `ui/components/*` exists — verified). Corrects PLAN's "~18" underestimate.
- **BL-040** 🟡 **🇩🇪 German language-learning UI** — `components/german.js` (⌘K → "German"): CEFR level (get/set),
  **check-my-German** (POST /correct → error list with match→hint), **flashcard review** (due → reveal → rate
  again/hard/good/easy → SRS), live stats. Verified end-to-end on the running app (level B1, correction,
  empty-deck review, token styling). Remaining: flashcard create/delete + calibration wizard (secondary).
- **BL-041** ✅ Missions board UI — `components/missions.js` (⌘K → "Missions board"): start a mission, kanban
  columns (running/paused/queued/done) grouped from `/missions`, per-status actions (pause/resume/cancel).
  Verified live (empty state) + with mock data (columns/cards/actions render correctly); token-styled.
- **BL-042** ✅ Journal UI — `components/journal.js` (⌘K → "Journal"): reads her entries (type badge + content
  + timestamp) and adds one (type + content → POST /journal). Verified live (fetch) + mock render + styling.
- **BL-043** ✅ Sync / Syncthing UI — `components/sync.js` (⌘K → "Sync (devices)"): status + peer devices +
  completion, this device's ID, rescan, and the setup guide (auto-opens when sync is off). Verified live
  (status off → 8-step guide renders). Remaining: add-device form (secondary).
- **BL-044** ✅ Codex / relationship UI — `components/codex.js` (⌘K → "Relationship codex"): workspace-scoped
  (editable path field pre-filled from #workspace-path) — entities Layla knows about + proposals
  (generate/approve/dismiss, query-param POSTs). Verified mock render (entities/sub/proposals/actions, accent).
- **BL-045** ✅ Knowledge-base UI (`kb.js`): browse `/intelligence/kb/articles`, read one (`/articles/{id}`), build from pasted text (`/build/text`). ⌘K → "Knowledge base". Verified live+mock: 2-article list w/ count, click→detail (accent title, pre-wrap content), back nav. _(AirLLM gen/chat/unload + compress/rag/optimize remain headless — low-value manual ops, deferred to a diagnostics sub-tab if ever needed.)_
- **BL-046** ✅ Debate UI — `components/debate.js` (⌘K → "Deliberate (aspects)"): pick a mode (Auto/Solo/
  Debate/Council/Tribunal from `/debate/modes`, pill selector), pose a question → POST /debate → synthesized
  answer + participating aspects. Verified live (modes render, mode selection, styling; real run invokes the model).
- **BL-047** ✅ Improvements UI — `components/improvements.js` (⌘K → "Improvements (self)"): lists
  self-improvement proposals (title + description + status), generate, approve/reject (batch-of-one). Verified
  live + mock render (item/status/actions, accent styling).
- **BL-048** ✅ Plans & projects UI (`plans.js`, 2-tab overlay): Plans tab — workspace-scoped list, create-by-goal, expand steps, approve (draft→), execute (approved→), status badges (draft/approved/executing/done/failed). Projects tab — list/create, pick one → fills workspace field. ⌘K → "Plans & projects". Verified live+mock: 3 plans w/ correct badge colors (text-dim/success/asp), per-status actions, step toggle, tab switch. _(patch/viz + project patch/delete remain as inline edits — deferred, low-value.)_
- **BL-049** ✅ Approvals + session-grants UI — `components/approvals.js` (⌘K → "Approvals & grants"): pending
  tool approvals (tool + args → approve[confirm-guarded, runs the tool]/deny) + active session grants with
  revoke-all. Verified live + mock (item/buttons/grant render, accent styling).
- **BL-050** ✅ Agent-tasks UI — `components/agent-tasks.js` (⌘K → "Background tasks"): start a background
  agent task (goal → POST /agent/background), list from /agent/tasks (goal + status colored by state), cancel
  active ones. Verified live + mock (running=cancelable/aspect-colored, completed=green). Remaining: steer/decision_trace (secondary).
- **BL-051** ✅ tools-history UI — `components/tools-history.js` (⌘K → "Tool history & health"): read-only
  dashboard from `/tools/analysis` — summary (calls · success% · tools) + per-tool table (calls, success rate
  colored green/amber/red, avg latency). Verified live (empty) + mock (table + rate colors after a specificity fix).
- **BL-052** ✅ Verify-learnings UI — `components/verify.js` (⌘K → "Verify learnings"): steps through the
  `/verify/*` queue — shows a fact Layla's unsure about + pending count, confirm (green) or reveal a
  correction box → POST /verify/answer, then next. Verified live (empty) + mock (fact/stats/confirm/correct).
- **BL-053** ✅ Calibration audit of the 6 componentized families (conversations, memory, character, research, workspace, obsidian). Method: extracted every route per router, diffed against fetched paths across ALL of `ui/`. **Closed the high-value gaps:** (1) Obsidian **status** + **diff** dry-run preview (`obsidian.js` + Options→Obsidian "Preview changes" button; connect now auto-loads counts; color-coded new/updated/conflicts file lists) — verified live+mock. (2) Memory **import** (`laylaImportMemoryBundle` in `memory.js` + overflow-menu "⬆ Import bundle"; multipart ZIP upload, counterpart to the existing export link) — verified live+mock (correct FormData POST, success toast). **Deliberately deferred (low-value/diagnostic/programmatic, not silently dropped):** `conversations/tags/suggest` (autosuggest; manual tags already work), `character/aspects/{id}/titles` + `earnable-titles` (read-only galleries; Lab already sets titles), `research_mission/debug` + `/verify` (diagnostics), `workspace/file_intent` + `project_discovery` + `file_content` (agent-internal, used programmatically), `memory/stats` (surfaced qualitatively in browser + diagnostics). Everything write-facing or user-blocking is now wired.
- **BL-054** ✅ (this session) System-diagnostics surfaced `cot_stats`/`metrics`/`security`/`capabilities`/`resources`; self-test surfaced `health`/`v1`.
- **BL-055** ✅ PLAN.md P4 corrected to **14 headless families / ~80 routes** (was "~18"); the separate "~18
  gated-OFF features" finding now points to the 15-feature manifest (BL-207) with wire/cut decisions recorded.

## W2b — Gated-OFF features (~18) → now ABSORBED into W-S/BL-207
Superseded by the Setup & Profiles keystone: each gated feature becomes a **feature-manifest entry**
selectable in onboarding (with install-on-demand), not a lone dead flag. Mostly "expose in the picker";
genuinely-dead ones ✂️ cut. The per-flag list below is retained as the manifest's input set.
- **BL-060/061/062** ✅ `inline_initiative` + `initiative_engine` → the `initiative` manifest feature;
  `initiative_project_proposals` folded under it (documented internal in BL-207).
- **BL-063** ✅ `engineering_pipeline` → `engineering` feature · **BL-064** ✅ `mcp_client` → `mcp` feature (MCP
  tests already pass, BL-140) · **BL-065** ✅ `multi_agent_orchestration` → `multi_agent` feature (added BL-207).
- **BL-066** ✅ `litellm` → `cloud_models` · **BL-067** ✅ `hyde` → `hyde` · **BL-068** ✅ `elasticsearch` →
  `search_elastic` · **BL-069** ✅ `meilisearch` → `search_meili`.
- **BL-070** ✅ `remote` → `remote` feature (palette-gated, BL-208) · **BL-071** ✅ `discord_bot_autostart` →
  `discord` feature.
- **BL-072** ✅ `ui_decision_trace` → surfaced by the Background-tasks panel (BL-050) · **BL-073** ✅
  `trace_id`/`telemetry_log_trivial` → `observability` feature (BL-207); `tunnel_audit` auto-on with remote (BL-026).
- **BL-074** ✅ `tool_replay_policy`/`pkg_policy_strict` → security-hardening admin flags, kept internal
  (documented in `setup_profiles.py`) · **BL-075** ✅ embedder/STT/TTS prewarm → `voice` (stt/tts) + `ml_stack`.
- **BL-076** ✅ `geometry_frameworks_enabled` — the cadquery/mesh/openscad backends are real; **fixed a latent bug**:
  the `fabrication` manifest feature set this to a bare bool `True`, but the backends do `enabled.get("cadquery",…)`
  so a bool would `AttributeError`-crash them → now sets the correct per-backend dict `{cadquery,trimesh,openscad,ezdxf}`
  matching `runtime_config.example.json`. Verified enable→dict→no crash.
- **BL-077** ✅ FabricationAssist runner — the `StubRunner` is an **intentional safe default** (validate/echo);
  real execution is opt-in `SubprocessJsonRunner` (config-gated) and the optional `fabrication_assist` package is
  handled gracefully (`fabrication_assist_not_installed`). Not a gap — documented design; deps install via `fabrication`.
- **BL-078** ✅ mem0 — ✂️ **cut** from the picker (redundant with native memory); flag kept internal only (BL-207).

## W3 — GUI finish (G2–G6)
- **BL-090** 🟡 G3 full form/card tokenization (some legacy input bgs kept).
- **BL-091** 🟡 G5 full 5-step onboarding **flow** (welcome · honesty-card · get-model · workspace · ready); self-test ✅.
- **BL-092** 🟡 REQ-79 aspect creator (name/sigil/sliders/voice/prompt + kit).
- **BL-093** 🟡 REQ-80 S.P.E.C.I.A.L.-style intake quiz.
- **BL-094** ⬜ REQ-81 / G6 per-aspect motion & polish (focus/reduced-motion ✅; motion choreography open).
- **BL-095** ✅ PLAN §6 palette reconciled to the **shipped** `layla-rebuild.css` `:root` (canonical): `--bg #0a0008`,
  `--accent #b11655` wine-rose, per-aspect `--asp` (morrigan #8b0000 …). Superseded #0a0710/#c0395e ("calm #1")
  and neon #0a0008/#c0006a noted as history, removed as the spec.

## W4 — Answer quality & eval
- **BL-100** 🟡 REQ-30 inline RAG grounding — **mechanism built + fully tested** (`services/retrieval/grounding.py`,
  `test_rag_grounding.py` 10 tests). Splits an answer into claims (skips questions/code/fragments), scores each for
  support against retrieved passages, emits a `grounding` block (per-claim supported + best **source citation**,
  overall score, cite-or-abstain). **Pluggable scorer**: model-free lexical containment by default (CPU,
  deterministic — catches zero-support hallucinations), `set_scorer()` swaps in NLI/MiniCheck for entailment-grade
  precision when a model is available. One-call `ground_answer(answer, query, cfg)` pulls passages from the KB and
  maps citations. Config `grounding_enabled`/`grounding_mode`(off|flag|abstain)/`grounding_min_support` (default
  **off** → non-invasive). Verified: supported→cited, hallucinated→flagged, abstain-mode hedges, empty-ctx→unsupported,
  NLI hook used. _Remaining: wire the one call into the reasoning handler + measure the gain with a live NLI model._
- **BL-101** ⬜ REQ-31 20–50 promptfoo golden set on PR + nightly.
- **BL-102** 🟡 UPG-01 hybrid escalation — **decision mechanism built + tested** (`services/llm/hybrid_escalation.py`,
  `test_hybrid_escalation.py` 10 tests). `answer_confidence()` scores an answer [0,1] from cheap model-free signals
  (explicit abstain ≤0.15, soft "not sure" ≤0.4, mild hedges, bare-fragment penalty) **and integrates the BL-100
  grounding score** (unsupported claims → low confidence). `should_escalate()` fires only when enabled AND a distinct
  bigger `escalation_model` is configured AND confidence < `escalation_confidence_threshold` (0.5) — a no-op on a
  single-model box. `escalation_decision()` returns a telemetry record. Config in runtime_safety, default off.
  Verified: confident→no-escalate, hedge/abstain/ungrounded→escalate, same-model target→no-op.
  _Remaining: wire the re-ask into the router + measure on a 2-model box._
- **BL-103** ✅ FlashRank reranker wired as the **preferred lightweight backend** (`reranker.py` auto chain:
  flashrank ONNX → sentence-transformers cross-encoder → BM25). **Fixed a perf bug**: the old code instantiated a
  CrossEncoder on **every** rerank call — now model instances are cached module-level (built once) with an
  unavailable-backend memo. Config `reranker_backend` (auto|flashrank|cross_encoder|bm25). Verified
  (`test_reranker_backends.py` 6 + 72 existing rerank tests): BM25 ranks the relevant doc first, backend selection,
  FlashRank built once across calls (cached), graceful fallback to BM25 when no ML deps, blank-query passthrough.
- **BL-104** ⬜ Measure GBNF accuracy gain (HumanEval-164 — the discriminating step past the 10-problem set).
- **BL-105** ⬜ Measure self-consistency gain at K>1 (mechanism ✅; benchmark pending).
- **BL-106** 🟡 REQ-20 tiny-model inference-smoke **CI job** (seam ready, job unwired — `stories260K`/SmolLM2).
- **BL-107** 🟡 REQ-22 release-gate: pin seed/top_k.
- **BL-108** ⬜ REQ-82 coding scaffolding: repo-map ✅(wired) · diff-edit · **codebase RAG** · KV-cache reuse.

## W5 — Config & maintainability
- **BL-120** ✅ Killed the `config.json` vs `runtime_config.json` drift. **Single source of truth** is
  `runtime_config.json` via `runtime_safety.load_config()` (wrapped by `config_cache.get_config()`, the consolidated
  R3 accessor). **Real bug fixed:** `prompt_optimizer._cfg()` read a phantom `services/config.json` that doesn't
  exist → always returned `{}`, so its keys were silently never honored; now uses `config_cache` (416 real keys).
  Corrected stale `config.json` references (docstrings + user-facing "set X in config.json" errors) across 8 modules
  (airllm, syncthing, sync, intelligence, prompt_compressor/optimizer, kb_builder, mdns) → `runtime_config.json`;
  removed orphaned imports. `config_schema.py` remains the schema surface (editable keys, categories, API schema,
  presets). Verified: `_cfg()` now returns the live config; 158 prompt/config tests green.
- **BL-121** 🟡 REQ-51 decompose `_autonomous_run_impl_core`; services stop importing `agent_loop` privates.
- **BL-122** 🟡 REQ-52 define shared UI data (ASPECTS) once; reduce `window.*` globals.

## W6 — Reliability & data
- **BL-130** ✅ Removed dead `LLMRequestQueue` — it was `.start()`/`.stop()`'d in main.py but **nothing ever
  called `.submit()`** (worker spun on an empty queue; the "all async paths use the queue" comment was false).
  Deleted the class + `_LLMRequest` + instance + the orphaned `dataclasses` import + the two main.py lifespan
  hooks. Documented the real model: `llm_serialize_lock` (single RLock) serializes all LLM access; async paths
  run generation in an executor under it. Also fixed a fragile pre-existing test (`performance_mode` builtin-default
  contract now hardware-independent: accepts auto **or** the lite_mode_auto low-downgrade). 405→406 green.
- **BL-131** 🟡 REQ-41 `save_learning` embed **outside** the write txn; `/health` reports model-load failure.
- **BL-132** ✅ REQ-42 backup complete: vector dir already backed up (R4); added **WAL checkpoint(TRUNCATE)** on
  the source before `.backup()` (fresh snapshot + bounded WAL on long-running DBs) and **VACUUM of the backup copy**
  (compacts, reclaims free pages from deletes/erasure — never touches the live DB). `wal_truncated` in the result.
  Verified (`test_db_backup_wal_vacuum.py`): data intact, backup is a self-contained single file, live DB usable after.
- **BL-133** ✅ REQ-43. **Erasure removes vectors** — already: `delete_learnings_by_id` collects `embedding_id`s and
  calls `delete_vectors_by_ids`, so forget/erase purges embeddings too. **Scrubs secrets/PII from logs** — the
  key-based `redact_payload` now also runs a **high-confidence value scrubber** (`scrub_secret_tokens`: sk-/xoxb-/
  ghp_/AKIA/AIza/Bearer/JWT/PEM, prefix-anchored → ~zero false positives) so a token embedded in a non-secret value
  (`args_preview`, `path`) is masked too; wired into `security_audit._record` so events are redacted **before** they
  hit the ring buffer or the log line. Verified (`test_secret_value_scrub.py` + existing `test_log_redaction`, 16 tests):
  tokens masked, normal diagnostic strings untouched, audit events carry no raw secret.
- **BL-134** ✅ Adaptive SM-2 spaced repetition now **actually accumulates**. The `sm2()` algorithm existed but
  `review_item()` reset ease/interval/reps to defaults every call, so intervals never grew (effectively fixed).
  Fix: persist per-item state — added `review_ease`/`review_interval_days`/`review_reps` columns (migration) +
  `get_review_state`/`set_review_state` in `learnings.py` (re-exported from `db.py`); `review_item` now loads prior
  state, applies SM-2, and persists. Verified (new `test_spaced_repetition_sm2.py`, 3 tests): interval grows
  1→6→>6 on success, resets to 1 on failure, state round-trips. 696-test memory suite green.

## W7 — Test coverage (un-skip the 30+)
- **BL-140** ✅ `tests/fixtures/fake_mcp_stdio.py` present (minimal stdio MCP server: initialize / tools/call) →
  `test_mcp_client_stdio.py` runs by default: **12 tests pass**, no skips.
- **BL-141** 🟡 Wire tiny real-LLM smoke in CI (`LAYLA_TEST_REAL_LLM` + a stub GGUF) → un-skip `test_inference_smoke.py` module + `test_benchmark_coding_model.py`.
- **BL-142** ⬜ Playwright + `requirements-e2e.txt` in CI → un-skip `e2e_ui/test_ui_smoke.py`.
- **BL-143** ✅ Resolved as **intentional optional dep** — tree-sitter is commented out in requirements.txt
  ("optional, heavy install"); `test_code_intelligence.py`/`test_workspace_index.py` `importorskip` it and degrade
  gracefully. Enablement (`pip install tree-sitter tree-sitter-python`) is now documented in `tests/README.md`.
- **BL-144** ✅ Already runs — `personalities/` exists in the repo, so `test_aspect_behavior.py` executes (40
  passed); the `skipif(not PERSONALITIES_DIR.exists())` is a graceful guard for stripped checkouts, not a gap.
- **BL-145** ✅ Created `tests/README.md` — documents every gated suite (real-LLM `LAYLA_TEST_REAL_LLM`, bench
  `LAYLA_BENCH_MODEL`, tree-sitter, playwright, ezdxf, nbformat, networkx, git, CI-conditional) with how to enable
  each, plus the present fixtures (fake MCP, personalities/). Audited: all **19** skip markers carry an explicit
  `reason=` (surface with `pytest -rs`) — no silent skips. New gated tests must add a reason + a README row.

## Definition-of-Done gates (the "truly-ready" bar)
1. Zero 🟡/⬜ in the UPG backlog (or each explicitly ✂️ cut).
2. Scope cut to the wedge (W9/Phase 3).
3. Security tier (W1) complete — safe to expose through a tunnel.
4. Full-app E2E green + one-command install (BL-174).
5. Truly-ready gate = Phase 7 polish complete.

**Honest sizing:** this is **weeks-to-months**. W0 is hours; W1 + W2 (German UI especially) are the
highest-leverage; W8/W11 are V2/V3 horizon.
