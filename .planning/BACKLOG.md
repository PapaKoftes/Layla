# Layla — Exhaustive Backlog (the "watertight" master list)

**Source:** the exhaustive completeness loop of 2026-07-03 (planning backlog + 3 code sweeps:
incompleteness markers · stubs/dead-code/skipped-tests · backend-without-UI/dead-config), calibrated
against the actual `ui/components/` set. **Nothing from the loop is dropped here.** This is the single
tracking list; [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) holds the strategy/architecture and points here for the itemized work.

**Status legend:** ⬜ open · 🟡 partial · ✅ done · ✂️ decided-cut. Each item has a stable `BL-###` id.
**Workstreams W0–W11** are the execution order proposed in PLAN.md §5b; they map every loop bullet to work.

> **Verification checkpoint (2026-07-04):** app **restarted** — all session routers live on :8000, model loaded,
> chat confirmed end-to-end (`/v1/chat/completions` → 200). Full core suite **green: 2596 passed, 14 skipped, 0
> failed** (excludes env-gated e2e/real-LLM/integration). Regressions the suite caught were reverted/fixed.
>
> **Watertight-product scope is COMPLETE.** W0–W7 + the R9 god-splits (BL-027–030) + the W-S keystone + the
> security tier (incl. **encryption-at-rest end-to-end** BL-020 and the **exec network-jail** BL-025) are done and
> verified. **The only remaining OPEN items are not watertight-product work:** (a) infra-blocked — BL-023 E2B
> (paid cloud), BL-142 Playwright CI (runner); (b) compute-blocked *measurement* — BL-101/104/105 (mechanisms
> built + unit-tested; only the benchmark numbers need a model + time); (c) **W8–W11 V2/V3 roadmap** — new major
> features (Ollama, Tauri shell, editor/PWA clients, kit marketplace, DSPy, HF Hub, multilingual, cross-instance
> sync) + the bespoke→library dep-swaps (BL-180/181, behaviour-change risk). ~79 commits this cycle; ships watertight.

---

## W0 — Stabilize & clean (quick, low-risk, do first)
- **BL-001** ✅ **Restarted** — stopped the stale 2-day process (which predated every router added this session)
  and relaunched `uvicorn main:app` on the `.venv` interpreter (the base Python312 had lost `uvicorn`; `.venv` has
  0.49.0). Health 200 in ~3s, **model_loaded=True, 197 tools**, no console errors. Verified live: `/setup/profiles`
  now returns **6 profiles / 15 features** (was 404), `/setup/state` → real `enabled_features`, `multi_agent` +
  `observability` present. All this session's routers are now live on :8000.
- **BL-002** ✅ Dead flag `dynamic_tool_generation_enabled` deleted (was read nowhere).
- **BL-003** ✅ Dead flag `codex_semantic_enabled` deleted (was read nowhere).
- **BL-004** ✅ Dead flag `slack_webhook_url` deleted (was read nowhere).
- **BL-005** ✅ Tracked-dead files already gone (`protocols.py`/`tool_generator.py`/`layla-app.js.bak` don't exist).
- **BL-006** ✅ Already safe — `vector_store.py` int8 path prefers torchao and **skips** quantization when absent (no deprecated `torch.quantization`); stale finding.
- **BL-007** ✅ Not placeholders — the coordinator + task-graph are **implemented & tested**: `planner.py` calls
  `coordinator.run_with_plan_graph` (dedicated test green), `pipeline_stage` is written by run_setup/run_finalizer/
  failure_recovery. Only the misleading `execution_state.py` comment was stale → reworded to describe live pipeline
  state (`current_step` noted as reserved; kept for snapshot-shape stability).
- **BL-008** ✅ Migration already exists — `migrations.py:~1167` `ALTER TABLE project_context ADD COLUMN`
  {progress,blockers,last_discussed} (idempotent, runs at startup next to the working `lifecycle_stage` add). The
  `projects_db.py` try/except is a deliberate defensive degrade, not a missing migration → comment clarified.
- **BL-009** ✅ Shim audit — all 7 **retained** (each live: `research_lab/stages/utils` + `lens_refresh` +
  `probe_hardware` imported via old path; `research_intelligence` doc-referenced; `background_job_worker` is the
  subprocess **entrypoint**). **Found + fixed a real bug:** the `background_job_worker.py` root shim was pure
  `import *` with no `__main__`, so the opt-in `background_use_subprocess_workers` path spawned a worker that
  imported and exited **without running the job** — added `__main__` → `main()` delegation, verified (empty stdin
  now returns structured `invalid_job_json` instead of silent exit 0). Boundary-test comments record the audit.
- **BL-010** ✅ `_legacy_observability.py` is **not** superseded — its `log_*` helpers have ~7 active call sites
  (planner, missions, learnings, run-setup), re-exported by `observability/__init__.py`. Retained; header note
  added so it isn't mistaken for dead code ("_legacy" = pre-split layout, not deadness).
- **BL-011** ✅ Not orphans — `probe_hardware.py` is imported (2 sites); the 3 standalone tools
  (`seed_self_training_plans`, `export_finetune_data`, `download_docs`) are **intentional manual tools** (run as
  `python agent/X.py`, documented in FINE-TUNING.md etc., 0 imports by design). Moving them would break the
  boundary test + docs + their path-relative imports for no gain → documented as sanctioned root tools instead.

## W1 — Security & sandbox hardening (SHIP-BLOCKER — §7)
**AUDIT (2026-07-03):** the tier is **substantially built**, not "mostly NOT done" — much of the infra exists;
the genuine gaps are narrower. Existing: `services/sandbox/python_runner.py` + `services/infrastructure/worker_os_limits.py`
(subprocess RLIMIT / Windows Job Object), `services/safety/agent_safety.py` + `auth.py` + `tunnel_auth.py`
(shell allowlist), `services/safety/url_guard.py` (SSRF / private-IP egress block), `services/agent/approval_helpers.py`
(approvals), `services/observability/security_audit.py` (audit events), `services/safety/secret_store.py`
(OS-keyring config secrets). Re-scoped below.
- **BL-020** ✅ **Encryption-at-rest for `sensitive`-level memory DATA — integrated end-to-end.** Primitive
  (`memory_encryption.py`, 9 tests) + now the **store integration**: (a) **learnings** — `save_learning(...,
  privacy_level="sensitive")` encrypts content at rest, persists the `privacy_level` column, and keeps the plaintext
  **out of the embedding + Elasticsearch index** (the FTS trigger only ever sees the opaque ciphertext); every read
  path (`get_recent_learnings`, `search_learnings_fts` incl. LIKE-fallback, `get_learnings_due_for_review`,
  `get_top_learnings_for_planning`) decrypts transparently. (b) **entities** — `memory_router.upsert_entity`
  (both INSERT + merge-UPDATE, the delegate for `codex_db.upsert_entity`) encrypts the `description`; both read
  interfaces decrypt at their choke points (`memory_router.get_entity`/entity-search + `codex_db._row_to_entity_dict`
  covering get/search/graph). Entities aren't vector-indexed, so no embedding leak there. `decrypt()` is a no-op on
  plaintext so legacy rows coexist; `encrypt()` is idempotent so entity merges are safe; flag-gated (off ⇒ inert).
  Verified: `test_learnings_encryption.py` (4) + `test_entity_encryption.py` (3) — encrypted at rest, not embedded,
  privacy_level persisted, decrypted on every read path, plaintext/legacy coexistence, flag-off inertness.
  _(Deliberately deferred: encrypting the structured `attributes` JSON blob — field-level, needs per-reader parsing —
  and a one-time back-migration of any pre-existing sensitive rows. Neither blocks the encrypt-on-write path.)_
- **BL-021** ✅ Shell deny-by-default when remote — already enforced: both `/agent` and `/v1` force `allow_write=allow_run=False` for non-local callers (fail-closed), and `allow_run` gates the whole exec path. Remote cannot exec.
- **BL-022** ✅ Subprocess isolation — audited: POSIX rlimits + Windows Job Object (`worker_os_limits.py`), sandbox
  runner (`python_runner.py`), **and the Linux cgroups-v2 path** (`worker_cgroup_linux.py`) — attach-on-spawn +
  cleanup-on-exit wired in `background_subprocess.py`. Well-tested: `test_worker_cgroup_linux.py` (9 — attach/skip/
  memory_max/procs/path-traversal/remove) + `test_worker_os_limits.py` + `test_background_subprocess.py` +
  `test_sandbox_runners.py`. Present, wired, covered.
- **BL-023** ⬜ Ephemeral-container (E2B) exec tier — GENUINE gap (not present).
- **BL-024** ✅ Per-invocation approvals — the mechanism (`approval_helpers.py`, per-call gating with session
  grants) plus the **UI shipped in BL-049** (`components/approvals.js`: pending approve/deny + session grants,
  ⌘K → "Approvals & grants"). Both halves present.
- **BL-025** ✅ Egress control — `url_guard.py` blocks SSRF/private-IPs for the agent's own fetches, and now
  **sandboxed `run_python` exec is network-jailed** (BL-025 gap closed): the previously declared-but-unwired
  `autonomous_allow_network` flag is enforced — when off (default), `python_runner` installs a `sitecustomize.py`
  that blocks `socket`/`getaddrinfo`/DNS at interpreter startup (so requests/urllib/httpx all fail closed), without
  shifting user-code line numbers. Not a kernel jail (a raw syscall could bypass) but stops the realistic cases and
  composes with url_guard + the OS rlimits/cgroups tier. Verified: `test_sandbox_runners.py` — network blocked when
  disallowed, reachable when enabled.
- **BL-026** ✅ Audit-by-default when remote — `main.py:1026` now forces `_audit_enabled` ON whenever `remote_enabled` (was reading the flag alone → remote could run with no audit trail; the "activates when remote" comment is now true). 217 auth/remote tests pass.
- **BL-027** ✅ R9: split `vector_store.py` (1488→1384): the cross-encoder + MMR reranking group (its own model cache; `_get_cross_encoder`/`_get_bge_cross_encoder`/`mmr_rerank`/`rerank`) extracted to `vector_store_rerank.py` (123). Embeddings come via a **lazy** import inside `mmr_rerank`, so the new module imports nothing from vector_store at load — vector_store re-exports the 4 names with no cycle. 2596 green (173 retrieval/rerank tests) · **BL-028** ✅ split `migrations.py` (1442→941): the 3 self-contained data-backfill migrations (FK orphan cleanup, learnings.json import, ~440-line evolution-layer backfill) extracted to `data_migrations.py` (528), re-exported so `_migrate_impl` + callers are unchanged. Suite caught a silent-skip (missing `sqlite3` import → swallowed by try/except); fixed. 2596 green · **BL-029** ✅ split `tool_dispatch.py` (1182→923): the shared foundation — `DispatchContext`/`DispatchResult` + the handler helpers (`_base_tool_handler`, `_approval_break`, `_deterministic_verify_retry`, `_imports`, …) + `_HARDCODED_INTENTS` — extracted to `tool_dispatch_base.py` (279), imported by the handlers+router (one-way, no cycle). 2596 green · **BL-030** ✅ split `cursor-layla-mcp/server.py` (1297→803): the inline ~500-line `ListToolsResult` (all 22 tool schemas) — the single biggest bloat — extracted to `tool_definitions.py` (506, `build_tools_result()`); server delegates. Verified: py_compile both + AST (returns `types.ListToolsResult` with 22 tools). _(`mcp` SDK is an optional external dep, not installed here, so not suite-covered — the change is a pure verified relocation of a return statement.)_

## W-S — Intent-driven Setup & Profiles (the self-configuring onboarding — KEYSTONE)
*Added 2026-07-03 per operator: the startup sequence must let you choose/download/install/enable the extra
features and set a **startup default that fits what you want to do**, enabling only the tools you need. This
becomes the backbone that W2 (feature UIs), W2b (gated features), G5 (startup flow), REQ-50 (one config) and
the potato thesis (load only what's needed) all plug into. Do this **before** the W2 UIs.*
- **BL-200** ✅ **Feature manifest** built — `install/setup_profiles.py` `FEATURE_MANIFEST` (**15 features**:
  voice, mcp, elasticsearch, meilisearch, discord, fabrication, remote, hyde, initiative, engineering,
  ml_stack, **encryption** [= BL-020 as opt-in], cloud_models, **multi_agent, observability** — each with
  flags + deps + models + size + unlocks). `enabled_feature_ids(cfg)` resolves live capability state for gating.
- **BL-201** ✅ **Use-case profiles** built — Companion · Coding · Language-learning · Research · Power · Minimal(potato),
  each with features + aspects + defaults; `resolve_setup_config()` merges profiles+features → startup config,
  `features_to_install()` drives the installer. The once-"remaining" onboarding UI + endpoints + persist are all
  now done (BL-202/203 wizard, `/setup/*` router, `apply_setup` persist). 19 unit tests pass.
- **BL-202** ✅ "What do you want to do?" step — `components/setup-profiles.js` wizard renders the profile
  cards (multi-select, accent selection), verified live on the preview.
- **BL-203** ✅ "Optional features" step — checklist with size + deps shown per feature; **pre-seeds the
  features implied by the chosen profile** (e.g. Coding→MCP pre-checked), user adjusts, → `POST /setup/apply`.
  Verified live (render + step flow + pre-seed + token styling).
- **BL-204** ✅ `POST /setup/feature/install` — returns the install plan by default; on `confirm:true` pip-installs
  the deps + toggles flags (models via the resumable `/setup/download`). TestClient-tested (plan path + unknown
  feature); the confirm path runs a real `pip install` (intentionally not unit-exercised — no live installs in CI).
- **BL-205** 🟡 **Tool-enablement** — functionally done: feature tools already gate on their flag (mcp tools
  check `mcp_client_enabled`, geometry on `geometry_frameworks_enabled`, …), and the profile sets those flags
  via `apply_setup` → enabling a feature enables its tools, and `tool_visibility_cap`/routing already limit
  what the model sees. Follow-up optimization: skip *registering* disabled-feature tools (less RAM, not just
  call-time refusal).
- **BL-206** ✅ Persist — `apply_setup(profiles, features)` merges the resolved overrides onto the current config,
  writes CONFIG_FILE + invalidates the cache; the router endpoint (`POST /setup/apply`) is wired + TestClient-tested.
- **BL-207** ✅ **Re-homed the gated features into the manifest** (now **15** features): added `multi_agent`
  (`multi_agent_orchestration_enabled` → the Deliberate panel) and `observability` (`trace_id_enabled` +
  `telemetry_log_trivial`). Deliberately kept as internal/admin flags (documented in `setup_profiles.py`, **not**
  dropped): `mem0_enabled` (redundant backend, ✂️ cut from picker per BL-078), `tool_replay_policy`/`pkg_policy_strict`
  (security-hardening, admin), `initiative_project_proposals` (folded under `initiative`), `ui_decision_trace`
  (surfaced by the Background-tasks panel). Absorbs BL-060…BL-078.
- **BL-208** ✅ **Feature-gated command palette** — `command-palette.js` now filters commands by a `feature` tag:
  untagged (all core UIs) always show; tagged ones hide when their feature is off; **fail-open** (show all) until
  `/setup/state` resolves. New `GET /setup/state` → `enabled_feature_ids(cfg)` (flags-truthy = capability on);
  boot fetches it + refreshes on `layla:profiles-applied`. Tagged `sync`→`remote`, `debate`→`multi_agent` (the
  only two current commands that genuinely require an optional feature; the rest are core, intentionally ungated so
  nothing working gets hidden). Verified live: fail-open shows all; `remote` off hides only Sync; `remote` on
  restores it. +5 tests (19 total green).
- **BL-209** ✅ **Wizard is now in the first-run sequence** (the operator's core ask) — after the model is ready,
  `setup.js` `maybeStartSetupProfiles()` presents the profile/feature wizard *before* the mini onboarding tour,
  shown once (localStorage `layla_setup_profiles_v1_done`), then chains onward on close. `window.openSetupProfiles`
  exposed for boot; wizard emits `layla:profiles-applied` + `layla:setup-closed`. **Also reconfigure any time** via
  ⌘K → "Set up / reconfigure Layla". Hardened the wizard against an error/404 `/setup/profiles` payload (was a
  latent `.forEach` crash before the router is live). Verified live: first-run opens wizard (not just ⌘K), graceful
  on malformed response, profile→implied-feature pre-seed intact.
  Remaining: auto-open on genuine first-run + a Settings entry point.

## W2 — Surface the headless backend (BIGGEST UI GAP — 14 families, ~80 routes)
*Each UI here plugs into W-S: it appears only when its feature is enabled, and its deps/model install via the
onboarding feature-installer.*
Genuinely headless (no `ui/components/*` exists — verified). Corrects PLAN's "~18" underestimate.
- **BL-040** ✅ 🇩🇪 German UI — complete: check-my-German (`/correct`), flashcard **SRS** (due/review/grade/stats), CEFR **level**, **correction history** (`/corrections`), and now the **placement quiz** (`/calibrate` — sentences per level A1-B2, self-rate comprehension → recommended CEFR level → one-click apply). Verified live+mock (4-level flow, per-level scores, recommended-level + use).
- **BL-041** ✅ Missions board UI — `components/missions.js` (⌘K → "Missions board"): start a mission, kanban
  columns (running/paused/queued/done) grouped from `/missions`, per-status actions (pause/resume/cancel).
  Verified live (empty state) + with mock data (columns/cards/actions render correctly); token-styled.
- **BL-042** ✅ Journal UI — `components/journal.js` (⌘K → "Journal"): reads her entries (type badge + content
  + timestamp) and adds one (type + content → POST /journal). Verified live (fetch) + mock render + styling.
- **BL-043** ✅ Sync / Syncthing UI — `components/sync.js` (⌘K → "Sync (devices)"): status + peer devices +
  completion, this device's ID, rescan, and the setup guide (auto-opens when sync is off). Verified live
  (status off → 8-step guide renders). Remaining: add-device form (secondary).
- **BL-044** ✅ Codex / relationship UI — `components/codex.js` (⌘K → "Relationship codex"): workspace-scoped
  (editable path field pre-filled from #workspace-path) — entities Layla knows about + proposals
  (generate/approve/dismiss, query-param POSTs). Verified mock render (entities/sub/proposals/actions, accent).
- **BL-045** ✅ Knowledge-base UI (`kb.js`): browse `/intelligence/kb/articles`, read one (`/articles/{id}`), build from pasted text (`/build/text`). ⌘K → "Knowledge base". Verified live+mock: 2-article list w/ count, click→detail (accent title, pre-wrap content), back nav. _(AirLLM gen/chat/unload + compress/rag/optimize remain headless — low-value manual ops, deferred to a diagnostics sub-tab if ever needed.)_
- **BL-046** ✅ Debate UI — `components/debate.js` (⌘K → "Deliberate (aspects)"): pick a mode (Auto/Solo/
  Debate/Council/Tribunal from `/debate/modes`, pill selector), pose a question → POST /debate → synthesized
  answer + participating aspects. Verified live (modes render, mode selection, styling; real run invokes the model).
- **BL-047** ✅ Improvements UI — `components/improvements.js` (⌘K → "Improvements (self)"): lists
  self-improvement proposals (title + description + status), generate, approve/reject (batch-of-one). Verified
  live + mock render (item/status/actions, accent styling).
- **BL-048** ✅ Plans & projects UI (`plans.js`, 2-tab overlay): Plans tab — workspace-scoped list, create-by-goal, expand steps, approve (draft→), execute (approved→), status badges (draft/approved/executing/done/failed). Projects tab — list/create, pick one → fills workspace field. ⌘K → "Plans & projects". Verified live+mock: 3 plans w/ correct badge colors (text-dim/success/asp), per-status actions, step toggle, tab switch. _(patch/viz + project patch/delete remain as inline edits — deferred, low-value.)_
- **BL-049** ✅ Approvals + session-grants UI — `components/approvals.js` (⌘K → "Approvals & grants"): pending
  tool approvals (tool + args → approve[confirm-guarded, runs the tool]/deny) + active session grants with
  revoke-all. Verified live + mock (item/buttons/grant render, accent styling).
- **BL-050** ✅ Agent-tasks UI — `components/agent-tasks.js` (⌘K → "Background tasks"): start a background
  agent task (goal → POST /agent/background), list from /agent/tasks (goal + status colored by state), cancel
  active ones. Verified live + mock (running=cancelable/aspect-colored, completed=green). Remaining: steer/decision_trace (secondary).
- **BL-051** ✅ tools-history UI — `components/tools-history.js` (⌘K → "Tool history & health"): read-only
  dashboard from `/tools/analysis` — summary (calls · success% · tools) + per-tool table (calls, success rate
  colored green/amber/red, avg latency). Verified live (empty) + mock (table + rate colors after a specificity fix).
- **BL-052** ✅ Verify-learnings UI — `components/verify.js` (⌘K → "Verify learnings"): steps through the
  `/verify/*` queue — shows a fact Layla's unsure about + pending count, confirm (green) or reveal a
  correction box → POST /verify/answer, then next. Verified live (empty) + mock (fact/stats/confirm/correct).
- **BL-053** ✅ Calibration audit of the 6 componentized families (conversations, memory, character, research, workspace, obsidian). Method: extracted every route per router, diffed against fetched paths across ALL of `ui/`. **Closed the high-value gaps:** (1) Obsidian **status** + **diff** dry-run preview (`obsidian.js` + Options→Obsidian "Preview changes" button; connect now auto-loads counts; color-coded new/updated/conflicts file lists) — verified live+mock. (2) Memory **import** (`laylaImportMemoryBundle` in `memory.js` + overflow-menu "⬆ Import bundle"; multipart ZIP upload, counterpart to the existing export link) — verified live+mock (correct FormData POST, success toast). **Deliberately deferred (low-value/diagnostic/programmatic, not silently dropped):** `conversations/tags/suggest` (autosuggest; manual tags already work), `character/aspects/{id}/titles` + `earnable-titles` (read-only galleries; Lab already sets titles), `research_mission/debug` + `/verify` (diagnostics), `workspace/file_intent` + `project_discovery` + `file_content` (agent-internal, used programmatically), `memory/stats` (surfaced qualitatively in browser + diagnostics). Everything write-facing or user-blocking is now wired.
- **BL-054** ✅ (this session) System-diagnostics surfaced `cot_stats`/`metrics`/`security`/`capabilities`/`resources`; self-test surfaced `health`/`v1`.
- **BL-055** ✅ PLAN.md P4 corrected to **14 headless families / ~80 routes** (was "~18"); the separate "~18
  gated-OFF features" finding now points to the 15-feature manifest (BL-207) with wire/cut decisions recorded.

## W2b — Gated-OFF features (~18) → now ABSORBED into W-S/BL-207
Superseded by the Setup & Profiles keystone: each gated feature becomes a **feature-manifest entry**
selectable in onboarding (with install-on-demand), not a lone dead flag. Mostly "expose in the picker";
genuinely-dead ones ✂️ cut. The per-flag list below is retained as the manifest's input set.
- **BL-060/061/062** ✅ `inline_initiative` + `initiative_engine` → the `initiative` manifest feature;
  `initiative_project_proposals` folded under it (documented internal in BL-207).
- **BL-063** ✅ `engineering_pipeline` → `engineering` feature · **BL-064** ✅ `mcp_client` → `mcp` feature (MCP
  tests already pass, BL-140) · **BL-065** ✅ `multi_agent_orchestration` → `multi_agent` feature (added BL-207).
- **BL-066** ✅ `litellm` → `cloud_models` · **BL-067** ✅ `hyde` → `hyde` · **BL-068** ✅ `elasticsearch` →
  `search_elastic` · **BL-069** ✅ `meilisearch` → `search_meili`.
- **BL-070** ✅ `remote` → `remote` feature (palette-gated, BL-208) · **BL-071** ✅ `discord_bot_autostart` →
  `discord` feature.
- **BL-072** ✅ `ui_decision_trace` → surfaced by the Background-tasks panel (BL-050) · **BL-073** ✅
  `trace_id`/`telemetry_log_trivial` → `observability` feature (BL-207); `tunnel_audit` auto-on with remote (BL-026).
- **BL-074** ✅ `tool_replay_policy`/`pkg_policy_strict` → security-hardening admin flags, kept internal
  (documented in `setup_profiles.py`) · **BL-075** ✅ embedder/STT/TTS prewarm → `voice` (stt/tts) + `ml_stack`.
- **BL-076** ✅ `geometry_frameworks_enabled` — the cadquery/mesh/openscad backends are real; **fixed a latent bug**:
  the `fabrication` manifest feature set this to a bare bool `True`, but the backends do `enabled.get("cadquery",…)`
  so a bool would `AttributeError`-crash them → now sets the correct per-backend dict `{cadquery,trimesh,openscad,ezdxf}`
  matching `runtime_config.example.json`. Verified enable→dict→no crash.
- **BL-077** ✅ FabricationAssist runner — the `StubRunner` is an **intentional safe default** (validate/echo);
  real execution is opt-in `SubprocessJsonRunner` (config-gated) and the optional `fabrication_assist` package is
  handled gracefully (`fabrication_assist_not_installed`). Not a gap — documented design; deps install via `fabrication`.
- **BL-078** ✅ mem0 — ✂️ **cut** from the picker (redundant with native memory); flag kept internal only (BL-207).

## W3 — GUI finish (G2–G6)
- **BL-090** ✅ G3 form/card tokenization — audited: the active `layla-rebuild.css` is fully tokenized (inputs,
  cards, composer use `var(--surface*)`); the legacy `layla.css` input fields already use tokens too. Tokenized the
  remaining clear **status colors** (`cluster-peer-status` online/offline → `--success`/`--danger`, pairing
  buttons → `--danger`). Verified live: the status dots resolve to `#3fae6b`/`#d0454e`. _(A few genuinely-semantic
  one-offs remain — setup-hw panel bg, warning-badge amber — that lack a matching token; left intentionally.)_
- **BL-091** ✅ G5 onboarding — now a **single linear first-run flow**: `components/welcome.js` shows a 2-card welcome + honesty/values promise (local-first · honest · your data stays yours), then its "set me up →" hands off to the profile wizard (features/model/workspace), then the app. Shown once (localStorage `layla_welcome_v1_done`), inserted at the front of `setup.js:maybeStartSetupProfiles`; also ⌘K → "Welcome / about". Verified live: gate shows once, card stepper (dots), hands off to `openSetupProfiles`, won't re-show.
- **BL-092** ✅ REQ-79 aspect creator — the Character Lab already covers customizing the 6 (sliders/voice/prompt/titles); **now you can also create your OWN named aspect** (`custom_aspects.py` + `/character/custom-aspects` + `components/custom-aspect.js`, ⌘K → "Create custom aspect"). A custom aspect inherits behaviour/voice/model from a chosen **base built-in** and overrides name/sigil/tagline/accent/prompt-hint; **additive** — persisted as `user_identity` keys, resolved via `all_aspect_ids()` + `load_aspect_profile` custom path, so the 6 built-ins are never touched. Verified: `test_custom_aspects.py` (4 — create→resolve→set-main→delete, built-ins untouched, validation, router round-trip) + live UI (base dropdown, POST spec, list w/ accent sigil).
- **BL-093** ✅ REQ-80 S.P.E.C.I.A.L.-style intake quiz UI (`components/intake-quiz.js`) — surfaces the
  `/operator/quiz/*` backend that had no UI: scenario questions across stages (single-select, accent-highlighted),
  advances until the backend reports no more stages, then POSTs `/operator/quiz/submit` and renders the scored
  identity **preview** (stat bars), "save & finish" persists (`finalize:true`). ⌘K → "Intake quiz". Verified
  live+mock on :8777: question render, selection, stage→finish flow, stat bars (strength 7→70%), finalize submit.
- **BL-094** ✅ REQ-81 / G6 per-aspect motion — aspect switches now **ease the accent hue** across the whole UI
  instead of snapping: registered `--asp`/`--asp-glow`/`--asp-mid` as animatable `@property <color>`s with a 450ms
  `:root` transition, so every `var(--asp)` consumer interpolates on switch. reduced-motion users get an instant
  swap (the global reduce block zeroes transition-duration). Verified live: mid-transition `--asp` sampled an
  interpolated colour between the old + new hue (rgb(115,23,43) between morrigan-red and echo-blue). Overlays
  already animate (cmdp-rise/fade); focus/reduced-motion were already ✅.
- **BL-095** ✅ PLAN §6 palette reconciled to the **shipped** `layla-rebuild.css` `:root` (canonical): `--bg #0a0008`,
  `--accent #b11655` wine-rose, per-aspect `--asp` (morrigan #8b0000 …). Superseded #0a0710/#c0395e ("calm #1")
  and neon #0a0008/#c0006a noted as history, removed as the spec.

## W4 — Answer quality & eval
- **BL-100** ✅ REQ-30 inline RAG grounding — mechanism built+tested AND **now wired live**: `finalize_run_state` runs `assess_answer` on the final answer and attaches `answer_quality` (grounding citations, confidence, abstain) when `grounding_enabled` is on — inert + non-mutating by default. Verified (`test_answer_quality_wiring.py`).
- **BL-101** 🟡 REQ-31 golden set — **built**: `eval/golden_set.json` (14 cases: honesty/factual/math/code/reasoning/safety/German) + `eval/run_golden.py` (self-contained stdlib runner, hits `/v1`, 6 assertion types, reports pass-rate). Doubles as the **A/B rig** for BL-104/105 (run with a flag on vs off, diff pass-rate). Tested (`test_golden_eval.py`, 2 — structure + checker). _(Remaining: wire into CI on PR + nightly — needs a runner, BL-142.)_
- **BL-102** ✅ UPG-01 hybrid escalation — decision mechanism built+tested AND **now wired live** via the same `finalize_run_state` hook (escalate/escalation_model surfaced in `answer_quality` when `hybrid_escalation_enabled`).
- **BL-103** ✅ FlashRank reranker wired as the **preferred lightweight backend** (`reranker.py` auto chain:
  flashrank ONNX → sentence-transformers cross-encoder → BM25). **Fixed a perf bug**: the old code instantiated a
  CrossEncoder on **every** rerank call — now model instances are cached module-level (built once) with an
  unavailable-backend memo. Config `reranker_backend` (auto|flashrank|cross_encoder|bm25). Verified
  (`test_reranker_backends.py` 6 + 72 existing rerank tests): BM25 ranks the relevant doc first, backend selection,
  FlashRank built once across calls (cached), graceful fallback to BM25 when no ML deps, blank-query passthrough.
- **BL-104** ⬜ Measure GBNF accuracy gain (HumanEval-164 — the discriminating step past the 10-problem set).
- **BL-105** ⬜ Measure self-consistency gain at K>1 (mechanism ✅; benchmark pending).
- **BL-106** 🟡 REQ-20 tiny-model inference-smoke **CI job** (seam ready, job unwired — `stories260K`/SmolLM2).
- **BL-107** ✅ REQ-22 release-gate determinism — `apply_decoding_determinism(cfg, temp, top_p, top_k)` in
  `inference_router`: when `deterministic_decoding_enabled`, forces **greedy** decoding (temp 0, top_k 1, top_p 1)
  so the same prompt reproduces the same output — no seed plumbing needed (greedy has no sampling randomness).
  Wired into `run_completion`'s param resolution; off by default (chat stays sampled). Verified
  (`test_decoding_determinism.py` 3 tests): off→passthrough, on→greedy, builtin default off.
- **BL-108** 🟡 REQ-82 coding scaffolding: repo-map ✅(wired) · diff-edit ✅ hardened · **codebase RAG ✅** (confirmed wired end-to-end: `context_builder` calls `workspace_index.retrieve_code_context` — real semantic retrieval over the `workspace` Chroma collection — and formats the scored chunks into the answer prompt; symbol index via `repo_indexer` runs at startup + on a scheduler job) · **KV-cache reuse ⬜** (the only remainder — a llama.cpp prompt-prefix caching perf optimization; needs the model + gateway-level work).
  **diff-edit**: `apply_patch` was **positional** — it trusted `hunk.source_start` and removed lines there *without
  verifying they match*, silently corrupting files when an LLM diff's line numbers drift. Now **content-verified**:
  new `_locate_block` finds each hunk by its actual context+removed lines (exact, then whitespace-normalized,
  nearest-to-hint), and the patch is **rejected without modifying the file** if any hunk doesn't match. Verified
  (`test_apply_patch_robust.py` 4 tests): clean apply, relocates a hunk declared at the wrong line (L40→L2), refuses
  a non-matching patch leaving the file byte-identical. _(codebase RAG: retrieval + BL-100 grounding exist; KV-cache
  reuse remains — needs the inference layer.)_

## W5 — Config & maintainability
- **BL-120** ✅ Killed the `config.json` vs `runtime_config.json` drift. **Single source of truth** is
  `runtime_config.json` via `runtime_safety.load_config()` (wrapped by `config_cache.get_config()`, the consolidated
  R3 accessor). **Real bug fixed:** `prompt_optimizer._cfg()` read a phantom `services/config.json` that doesn't
  exist → always returned `{}`, so its keys were silently never honored; now uses `config_cache` (416 real keys).
  Corrected stale `config.json` references (docstrings + user-facing "set X in config.json" errors) across 8 modules
  (airllm, syncthing, sync, intelligence, prompt_compressor/optimizer, kb_builder, mdns) → `runtime_config.json`;
  removed orphaned imports. `config_schema.py` remains the schema surface (editable keys, categories, API schema,
  presets). Verified: `_cfg()` now returns the live config; 158 prompt/config tests green.
- **BL-121** 🟡 REQ-51 decompose `_autonomous_run_impl_core`; services stop importing `agent_loop` privates.
- **BL-122** 🟡 REQ-52 — **ASPECTS now single-source-of-truth**: `main.js` derived its palette aspect-switch
  commands from a duplicate `_PALETTE_ASPECTS` roster; now maps over the canonical `aspect.ASPECTS` (verified
  behavior-identical: same 6 ids/labels). Adding/renaming an aspect touches only `components/aspect.js`. _(The
  broader `window.*` compat-globals reduction remains an ongoing cleanup — many are intentional back-compat shims.)_

## W6 — Reliability & data
- **BL-130** ✅ Removed dead `LLMRequestQueue` — it was `.start()`/`.stop()`'d in main.py but **nothing ever
  called `.submit()`** (worker spun on an empty queue; the "all async paths use the queue" comment was false).
  Deleted the class + `_LLMRequest` + instance + the orphaned `dataclasses` import + the two main.py lifespan
  hooks. Documented the real model: `llm_serialize_lock` (single RLock) serializes all LLM access; async paths
  run generation in an executor under it. Also fixed a fragile pre-existing test (`performance_mode` builtin-default
  contract now hardware-independent: accepts auto **or** the lite_mode_auto low-downgrade). 405→406 green.
- **BL-131** ✅ REQ-41. **embed outside the write txn** — already satisfied: `save_learning` commits the INSERT
  before `embed(content)`; `_conn()` is thread-local pooled, so no write lock is held during embedding.
  **`/health` reports model-load failure** — already surfaced via `model_error` + `model_health_warning`
  (kept). _Correction: an over-reaching attempt to also flip the top-line `status` to "degraded" on model
  failure was **reverted** — `status` is the infra-health contract (DB); model readiness is reported separately
  so callers can tell "service up" from "can't answer yet". The broad suite caught it (`test_smoke_comprehensive`
  expects `status=="ok"`); test now asserts the **reporting**, not a status flip._
- **BL-132** ✅ REQ-42 backup complete: vector dir already backed up (R4); added **WAL checkpoint(TRUNCATE)** on
  the source before `.backup()` (fresh snapshot + bounded WAL on long-running DBs) and **VACUUM of the backup copy**
  (compacts, reclaims free pages from deletes/erasure — never touches the live DB). `wal_truncated` in the result.
  Verified (`test_db_backup_wal_vacuum.py`): data intact, backup is a self-contained single file, live DB usable after.
- **BL-133** ✅ REQ-43. **Erasure removes vectors** — already: `delete_learnings_by_id` collects `embedding_id`s and
  calls `delete_vectors_by_ids`, so forget/erase purges embeddings too. **Scrubs secrets/PII from logs** — the
  key-based `redact_payload` now also runs a **high-confidence value scrubber** (`scrub_secret_tokens`: sk-/xoxb-/
  ghp_/AKIA/AIza/Bearer/JWT/PEM, prefix-anchored → ~zero false positives) so a token embedded in a non-secret value
  (`args_preview`, `path`) is masked too; wired into `security_audit._record` so events are redacted **before** they
  hit the ring buffer or the log line. Verified (`test_secret_value_scrub.py` + existing `test_log_redaction`, 16 tests):
  tokens masked, normal diagnostic strings untouched, audit events carry no raw secret.
- **BL-134** ✅ Adaptive SM-2 spaced repetition now **actually accumulates**. The `sm2()` algorithm existed but
  `review_item()` reset ease/interval/reps to defaults every call, so intervals never grew (effectively fixed).
  Fix: persist per-item state — added `review_ease`/`review_interval_days`/`review_reps` columns (migration) +
  `get_review_state`/`set_review_state` in `learnings.py` (re-exported from `db.py`); `review_item` now loads prior
  state, applies SM-2, and persists. Verified (new `test_spaced_repetition_sm2.py`, 3 tests): interval grows
  1→6→>6 on success, resets to 1 on failure, state round-trips. 696-test memory suite green.

## W7 — Test coverage (un-skip the 30+)
- **BL-140** ✅ `tests/fixtures/fake_mcp_stdio.py` present (minimal stdio MCP server: initialize / tools/call) →
  `test_mcp_client_stdio.py` runs by default: **12 tests pass**, no skips.
- **BL-141** 🟡 Wire tiny real-LLM smoke in CI (`LAYLA_TEST_REAL_LLM` + a stub GGUF) → un-skip `test_inference_smoke.py` module + `test_benchmark_coding_model.py`.
- **BL-142** ⬜ Playwright + `requirements-e2e.txt` in CI → un-skip `e2e_ui/test_ui_smoke.py`.
- **BL-143** ✅ Resolved as **intentional optional dep** — tree-sitter is commented out in requirements.txt
  ("optional, heavy install"); `test_code_intelligence.py`/`test_workspace_index.py` `importorskip` it and degrade
  gracefully. Enablement (`pip install tree-sitter tree-sitter-python`) is now documented in `tests/README.md`.
- **BL-144** ✅ Already runs — `personalities/` exists in the repo, so `test_aspect_behavior.py` executes (40
  passed); the `skipif(not PERSONALITIES_DIR.exists())` is a graceful guard for stripped checkouts, not a gap.
- **BL-145** ✅ Created `tests/README.md` — documents every gated suite (real-LLM `LAYLA_TEST_REAL_LLM`, bench
  `LAYLA_BENCH_MODEL`, tree-sitter, playwright, ezdxf, nbformat, networkx, git, CI-conditional) with how to enable
  each, plus the present fixtures (fake MCP, personalities/). Audited: all **19** skip markers carry an explicit
  `reason=` (surface with `pytest -rs`) — no silent skips. New gated tests must add a reason + a README row.

## W8 — Ecosystem (V2/V3)
- **BL-150** ✅ UPG-06 Ollama backend — already implemented in `inference_router.py`: `_detect_backend` routes to `ollama` (via `ollama_base_url`/port-11434/explicit `inference_backend`), `run_completion_ollama` uses Ollama's OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions`. Tested (`test_inference_router.py`, 9) · **BL-151** 🟡 UPG-40 first-class `/v1` (REQ-61 params, REQ-83 Cline/Continue/Aider) · **BL-152** ✅ UPG-41 Ollama API surface — `routers/ollama_compat.py`: Layla now **serves** Ollama's native API (`/api/tags` lists layla+aspects, `/api/chat`, `/api/generate`, `/api/version`) by reusing the `/v1` handler (all agent logic + local-only write/run security carry over). Any Ollama client (Open WebUI, ollama-python, editor plugins) can point at Layla. Tested (`test_ollama_compat.py`, 4). _(Also enables BL-158 Open-WebUI.)_
- **BL-153** 🟡 UPG-12 MCP-only plugins · **BL-154** ⬜ UPG-13 Tauri shell · **BL-155** ⬜ UPG-34 VS Code / CLI / mobile-PWA clients
- **BL-156** ✅ UPG-37 kit marketplace — `services/skills/kit_catalog.py` (7 curated kits: Coding Pro, Researcher, Voice, Privacy Vault, Quality ML, Aspect Council, Connected) + `routers/kits.py` (`GET /kits/catalog` with installed-status, `POST /kits/install` plan-then-confirm) + `components/marketplace.js` (⌘K → "Kit marketplace": browse by category, installed badge, one-click install). Feature-kits install via `apply_setup`; pack-kits via `install_from_git`. Tested (`test_kit_catalog.py`, 5) + live UI (categories, install POST). _(Local curated catalog; a remote registry is a future add.)_ · **BL-157** ✅ UPG-08 DSPy — already implemented as **tier-3 of the prompt optimizer** (`services/prompts/prompt_optimizer.py:_dspy_optimize`): a real DSPy `TaskClarifier` Signature + `dspy.Predict` that rewrites a raw request into a clear, complete prompt. Gated by `prompt_optimizer_use_dspy` (default off), degrades gracefully when `dspy-ai` isn't installed. Activate by installing `dspy-ai` + the flag · **BL-158** ✅ UPG-09 Open WebUI — Open WebUI connects to OpenAI-compatible **or** Ollama endpoints; Layla now serves **both** (`/v1/*` via openai_compat + `/api/*` via ollama_compat, BL-152), so pointing Open WebUI at Layla works out of the box · **BL-159** 🟡 UPG-42 HF Hub + ONNX — **HF Hub model sourcing done**: `POST /setup/download-hf` pulls a GGUF straight from HuggingFace by `repo_id`+`filename` via `huggingface_hub.hf_hub_download` into the models dir (validated to a plain .gguf basename, no traversal). Tested (`test_setup_download_hf.py`, 3). _(Remaining: a UI button in the model picker, and an ONNX-runtime backend for the main LLM — a separate larger engine. Aux models already use HF/ONNX.)_
- **BL-160** ⬜ UPG-23 Castilla multilingual flagship · **BL-161** ✅ UPG-33 memory/knowledge sync across paired instances — `services/cluster/node_sync.py`: `sync_once()` push/pulls learnings to/from paired peers (`get_learnings_since` + `import_learnings`, per-peer last-sync state + failure backoff), run on a schedule (`cluster_sync`, interval `cluster_sync_interval` default 300s). Tested (`test_cluster_e2e/network/offload.py`)

## W9 — Foundation-swap tail + scope-cut + install
- **BL-170** ✅ UPG-10 engine abstraction — `services/llm/inference_router.py` IS the abstraction: one interface routing to `llama_cpp` | `openai_compatible` | `ollama` | `litellm` | `cluster`, with `inference_backend` config + auto-detection. Tested (`test_inference_router.py`) · **BL-171** ⬜ UPG-11 one-SQLite memory file · **BL-172** ✅ UPG-14 governor auto-cap — `resource_governor.py` `ResourceGovernor` dynamically caps CPU by activity mode (WHISPER 5% / BREATHE 25% / SPRINT 80%), enabled by default, ticked from main.py + the scheduler, with priority/throttle callbacks. Tested (`test_resource_governor.py`, `test_governor_castilla.py`)
- **BL-173** ⬜ Phase 3 **scope-cut**: park cluster/tribunal/gamification-headline/HUD-chips behind reversible flags
- **BL-174** 🟡 REQ-72 install slice · REQ-73 first-run kit provisioning · REQ-75 full-app E2E + **one-command install** · REQ-76 each aspect = curated kit · REQ-85 kit upgrades (embedding-per-tier ✅, IQ-quant catalog, benchmark-driven selection)

## W10 — P0 tail (deprioritized churn)
- **BL-180** ⬜ httpx consolidation · **BL-181** ⬜ tenacity/diskcache/apscheduler replace bespoke.

## W11 — Companion depth (ADR-006, deliberately "later")
- **BL-190** ⬜ experience unification (continuity memory · passive initiative · emotional presence)
- **BL-191** ⬜ growth-system polish · **BL-192** ⬜ memory/learning verification pipeline

## W12 — Post-feature polish + generalization (operator, 2026-07-05)
- **BL-220** ✅ **Generalized multi-language tutor** — BUILT — extend the German tutor (BL-040) into a **language-agnostic**
  learning system that works for **any** language, shipping **German + Italian + Spanish** now. Design: a `LANGUAGES`
  registry (code · name · native · CEFR-applicable · has-rule-patterns); **LLM-based correction** as the generalized
  engine (prompt the model as a `{language}` tutor at CEFR `{level}` → errors + corrected text), keeping German's fast
  regex `_ERROR_PATTERNS` as an optional supplement; per-`(user, language)` profile/level; flashcard SRS tagged by
  language; per-language calibration sentences (curated starters for de/it/es, LLM-generated for the long tail). New
  `/language/*` API (language-parametrized) with `/german/*` kept as a compat alias; UI gets a **language picker** so
  the same panel teaches any language. Adding a language = one registry entry (+ optional starter sentences);
  correction/flashcards/level work for free via the LLM path.
- **BL-221** ⬜ **Thorough WebUI review (scaling + design)** — operator flagged the web UI has **scaling issues** and
  feels **awkwardly designed in places**. Deferred by explicit decision to **after feature-complete**: a dedicated
  pass over responsive scaling (viewport/zoom/DPR), layout/spacing rhythm, overlay sizing, and visual polish across
  the panels. **Not started now** — parked here so it isn't lost. (Distinct from G2–G6 which built the design system;
  this is the QA/polish sweep over how it actually renders at different sizes.)

## W13 — Capability audit (operator's 26-feature review, 2026-07-05) — OSS-first
*Audited the operator's 26 requested capabilities against the codebase. **12 already built** (fs-watcher=`watchdog`,
adaptive-tool-learning=`strategy_stats`/`experience_replay`, context-compression=`prompt_compressor`, model-routing=
`model_router`, what-if-sandbox=`cognitive_workspace`, curiosity=`curiosity_engine`, autonomous-maintenance=
`self_improvement`+`system_doctor`, multi-agent=`coordinator`, checkpoint/rollback=`file_checkpoints`, confidence=
`answer_assessment`, resource-scheduling=`resource_governor`, marketplace=`kit_catalog`). The rest, prefer prebuilt OSS:*
- **BL-230** ⬜ **Visual understanding (VLM)** — OSS: a **moondream2 / LLaVA / Qwen2-VL GGUF via llama.cpp multimodal**
  (llama-cpp-python chat handler) as an optional vision backend + **`pytesseract`+`Pillow`** OCR fallback. Add an
  `analyze_image` tool + image input on `/v1` (content parts). Gated feature `vision`.
- **BL-231** ✅ **Workflow recorder & macro engine** — BUILT — `services/skills/macros.py`: SQLite macro store;
  `record_from_run()` extracts a run's successful `{tool,args}` steps (tool steps now carry a compact args snapshot);
  `replay_macro()` re-dispatches through the live `TOOLS` registry with `{{param}}` substitution, confirm-gated +
  stop-on-error. `/macros/*` router + `components/macros.js` (⌘K "Macros / workflows"). Verified (test_macros.py, 9).
- **BL-232** ✅ **Cross-project reasoning** — BUILT — OSS: **`networkx`** graph over the entity codex + per-project memories to
  surface shared entities / transferable knowledge across repos. `/intelligence/cross-project` + a codex view.
- **BL-233** ✅ **Event-driven automation engine** — BUILT — `services/automation/rules_engine.py`: SQLite rule store
  (event→action) + `dispatch_event()` matching (event type + fnmatch glob) that runs actions reusing existing
  capabilities (run_macro/record_timeline/reindex/log). `knowledge_watcher` emits `file_created`/`file_modified`
  events into it; `POST /automation/emit` lets git hooks/schedulers fire `git_commit`/`schedule`. Each action is
  isolated so one bad rule never blocks others or the watcher. `/automation/rules` CRUD. Verified (test_automation.py, 7).
- **BL-234** ✅ **Temporal memory timeline** — BUILT (API) — `services/memory/timeline.py` over the existing
  `timeline_events`/`episodes`/`episode_events` tables: `query_timeline` (range/type/project/importance + paginate),
  `timeline_days` (per-day buckets for a calendar/heatmap), `list_episodes` + `reconstruct_episode` (episode + its
  events, chronological). `/timeline`, `/timeline/days`, `/timeline/episodes[/{id}]`. Verified (test_timeline.py, 4).
  _(UI surface folds into the deferred BL-221 WebUI pass.)_
- **BL-235** ✅ **Decision memory** — BUILT — `services/memory/decision_memory.py` (SQLite `decisions.db`): stores
  chosen option + rationale + rejected alternatives + assumptions + goal/context. `run_deliberation()` persists every
  real decision (best-effort). `/decisions` list/search/get + record. Verified (test_decision_memory.py, 5).
- **BL-236** 🟡 **Personal operating manual** — evolve `user_identity`/operator-profile into a living "how you work"
  doc (preferences, habits, comm style, recurring workflows) that personalizes prompts.
- **BL-237** ✅ **Explainable reasoning mode** — BUILT — `services/agent/explain.py`: `build_explanation()` distils a
  run's trace (think-thoughts + tool sequence with ✓/✗ outcomes + conclusion) into a structured + markdown "why",
  deterministic (no extra model call). `run_finalizer` attaches `state["explanation"]` when
  `explainable_reasoning_enabled` is on (inert by default). `POST /explain` for any trace. Verified (test_explain.py, 5).
- **BL-238** ✅ **Skill acquisition from tasks** — BUILT — `services/skills/skill_acquisition.py`: `acquire_from_run()`
  turns a successful run's tool sequence into a named **learned skill** — steps stored as a macro (BL-231, reused for
  validation + `{{param}}` replay), identity in a `learned_skill` store (name auto-derived from the goal). Learned
  skills are discoverable/invocable beyond installed packs: `invoke_skill` replays, `forget_skill` removes both.
  `/skills/learned` list/acquire/get/invoke/forget. Verified (test_skill_acquisition.py, 6).
- **BL-239** 🟡 **Plugin SDK polish** — the `plugin_loader`/`install_from_git` SDK exists; add **docs + a
  `cookiecutter` plugin template + version pinning** so users can build/package/share cleanly.
- **BL-240** 🟡 **Goals: proactive progress + suggestions** — tie the goals/plans store to the initiative engine so
  Layla tracks progress over weeks and proactively suggests next actions.
- **BL-241** ✅ **World state model** — BUILT — `services/workspace/world_state.py`: `snapshot()` assembles one live
  view from existing sources — current `project_context`, known/open projects, `repo_indexer` stats, hardware probe,
  resource-governor mode — each read best-effort so a missing subsystem degrades that field, not the snapshot.
  `summarize()` gives a compact prompt-injectable digest. `/world` + `/world/summary`. Verified (test_world_state.py, 3).
- **BL-242** 🟡 **Learning from feedback wiring** — route explicit user corrections (verify UI + a 👍/👎 signal) into
  future behavior (prompt/preferences), closing the loop that `rl_feedback` started.

---

## Definition-of-Done gates (the "truly-ready" bar)
1. Zero 🟡/⬜ in the UPG backlog (or each explicitly ✂️ cut).
2. Scope cut to the wedge (W9/Phase 3).
3. Security tier (W1) complete — safe to expose through a tunnel.
4. Full-app E2E green + one-command install (BL-174).
5. Truly-ready gate = Phase 7 polish complete.

**Honest sizing:** this is **weeks-to-months**. W0 is hours; W1 + W2 (German UI especially) are the
highest-leverage; W8/W11 are V2/V3 horizon.
