## Pinned versions and paths

- **Python**: 3.11+ (tested 3.11–3.12). Dependencies: `agent/requirements.txt`.
- **Database**: SQLite at **repo root** `layla.db`. All persistent memory (learnings, study_plans, wakeup_log, audit, aspect_memories, project_context, capabilities) lives here.
- **Config**: `agent/runtime_config.json` (gitignored). Template at `agent/runtime_config.example.json`.
- **Model**: `models/<filename>.gguf` (gitignored). Set `model_filename` in config.

## Request flow

```
Client
  → HTTP → FastAPI (agent/main.py, port 8000)
  → Router dispatch:
      /agent, /learn/          → routers/agent.py    → agent_loop.autonomous_run()
      /research_mission        → routers/research.py → agent_loop (research_mode=True)
      /study_plans, /wakeup    → routers/study.py
      /approve, /pending       → routers/approvals.py
      /voice/transcribe        → services/stt.py     (faster-whisper)
      /voice/speak             → services/tts.py     (kokoro-onnx)
      /health, /v1/*, /ui      → main.py (inline)
```

**agent_loop.autonomous_run():**
1. `runtime_safety.load_config()` — TTL-cached, hot-path safe
2. `orchestrator.select_aspect()` — keyword-based, loads `personalities/*.json`
3. `_build_system_head()` — identity + knowledge RAG (BM25+vector+FTS5+rerank) + learnings + CoT; passes through `context_manager.build_system_prompt()` for token budgets and deduplication
4. **Cognitive workspace** (if `enable_cognitive_workspace`): generate approaches → evaluate → choose best; inject `strategy_hint` into decision prompt and plan context
5. **Planning** (if `should_plan`): `create_plan` → `execute_plan`; each step runs `autonomous_run` recursively
6. **Decision loop** (up to `max_tool_calls`):
   - `_llm_decision()` → parse JSON `{action, tool_name, objective_complete, ...}`
   - If `action=tool`: `registry.TOOLS[name]()` — gated by `allow_write`/`allow_run` + approval
   - If `action=reason` or `objective_complete`: `_completion()` → stream final reply
7. Optional self-reflection (`enable_self_reflection`) — score + rewrite if < 7/10
8. `_save_outcome_memory()` — distill and store outcome; reflection engine (what worked/failed/improve)

**Approval:** tool returns `approval_required` → queued in `shared_state.pending` → `POST /approve {"id": uuid}` → proceed

## Sovereign platform subsystems

- **First-run installer**: `agent/install/` — `hardware_probe.py` (CPU, RAM, GPU, CUDA/ROCm/Metal), `model_selector.py` (catalog-based recommendation), `model_downloader.py` (huggingface_hub or urllib), `installer_cli.py` (interactive wizard). Models in `~/.layla/models/`. Config: `models_dir`, `resolve_model_path()` in `runtime_safety`.
- **Hardware detection**: `services/hardware_detect.py` — CPU, RAM, GPU, VRAM, acceleration backend, machine tier. Used by `runtime_safety`, `first_run`, `model_recommender`.
- **Model recommender**: `services/model_recommender.py` — recommends model size/quantization from hardware.
- **Model manager**: `services/model_manager.py` — list/install/benchmark models under `~/.layla/models/` (config: `models_dir`).
- **Skills**: `layla/skills/registry.py` — named workflows (analyze_repo, research_topic, etc.). Planner injects skill hints when `skills_enabled`.
- **Plugins**: `plugins/*/plugin.yaml` — auto-loaded at startup. Add skills and optional tools via `services/plugin_loader.py`.
- **Model benchmark**: `services/model_benchmark.py` — tokens/sec on load when `benchmark_on_load`.
- **Memory distillation**: `layla/memory/distill.py` — Jaccard + optional semantic clustering; `distill_rules()` for rule extraction.
- **Token budgeting**: `services/context_budget.py` — allocates token limits per prompt section (identity, memory, knowledge, graph, workspace). Used by `context_manager.build_system_prompt()`.
- **Context management**: `services/context_manager.py` — centralized prompt assembly with per-section token budgets (from context_budget), deduplication, conversation summarization, and observability. Summaries persist to `conversation_summaries` (with embeddings) for retrieval.
- **Graph reasoning**: `services/graph_reasoning.py` — spaCy entity extraction + networkx graph expansion. Query context expands via knowledge graph relationships. Integrated into `retrieval.retrieve_graph_context`. `services/graph_cache.py` caches expansion results (TTL 300s) to avoid repeated BFS.
- **Code intelligence**: `services/workspace_index.py` — tree-sitter extracts functions, classes, imports, call graph from Python. `extract_code_architecture()`, `get_architecture_summary()`, `build_workspace_graph()` (semantic dependency graph: files, functions, classes, imports; edges: calls, imports, inherits, depends_on, implements), `get_workspace_dependency_context(query)` for coding tasks. Injected into `_build_system_head` when coding keywords detected.
- **Parallel agent roles**: `services/task_graph.py` — `run_parallel_ready()`, `run_until_complete_parallel()` for concurrent execution of planner, researcher, executor, critic, memory_curator when dependencies permit. Adaptive parallelism: workers adjust dynamically by CPU/RAM (psutil).
- **Capability registry**: `capabilities/registry.py` — capability types (vector_search, embedding, reranker, web_scraper) with multiple implementations. Selection priority: 1) `capability_impls` config override, 2) best benchmark score, 3) default.
- **Capability discovery**: `services/capability_discovery.py` — `discover_candidate_libraries`, `fetch_pypi_candidates`, `fetch_github_candidates`; scans PyPI, GitHub, HuggingFace.
- **Integration sandbox**: `services/integration_sandbox.py` — temp venv, install candidate, compatibility tests, benchmarks; isolated from Layla runtime.
- **Benchmark suite**: `services/benchmark_suite.py` — latency, throughput, memory for vector_search, embedding, reranker, web_scraper; stores in `capability_implementations`.
- **Sandbox validator**: `services/sandbox_validator.py` — import check + benchmark before enabling a capability.
- **Performance monitor**: `services/performance_monitor.py` — runtime metrics (tool latency, retrieval, token throughput).
- **System optimizer**: `services/system_optimizer.py` — collects CPU, RAM, GPU, token throughput, tool latency, retrieval latency; applies adaptive runtime overrides (context size, parallel tasks, retrieval depth). Changes are runtime-only; never persist to `runtime_config.json`.
- **Observability**: `services/observability.py` — structured logging for agent_decision, tool_call, tool_result, retrieval_cache_hit/miss; records to performance_monitor for system_optimizer.

## Companion intelligence subsystem

1. **Relationship memory** — `db.relationship_memory` stores meaningful interaction summaries (user_event, timestamp, embedding_id). Populated when conversation is compressed. Injected into `_build_system_head` as "Recent relationship context".
2. **Timeline events** — `db.timeline_events` stores personal timeline (event_type, content, timestamp, importance). Populated on conversation compress. Injected as "Recent timeline".
3. **User identity** — `db.user_identity` stores long-term companion context (verbosity, humor_tolerance, formality, response_length, life_narrative_summary). Tools: `get_user_identity`, `update_user_identity`. Injected as "User/companion context".
4. **Style profile** — `services/style_profile.py` tracks tone, preferred response style, frequent topics via embeddings + clustering. Updates `db.style_profile`. Injected when `enable_style_profile` is true.
5. **Voice** — `stt.detect_voice_mode`, `stt.transcribe_streaming`; `tts.get_voice_options`, configurable `tts_voice` in runtime_config.
6. **Context injection** — `_build_system_head` injects: relationship memory, timeline events, user identity, conversation summaries, style profile (tone, topics, response_style), personal knowledge graph, reasoning strategies (for complex goals), active goals.
7. **Reflection engine** — `services/reflection_engine.py`: after task completion, generate what worked/failed/could improve; store as learnings.
8. **Knowledge distiller** — `services/knowledge_distiller.py`: periodically compress learnings into higher-level insights.
9. **Tool outcome learning** — `layla.memory.db.tool_outcomes`: record success/latency; planner prefers higher-reliability tools.
10. **Goal engine** — `goals`, `goal_progress` tables; tools: add_goal, add_goal_progress, get_active_goals; integrated with project context.
11. **Curiosity engine** — `services/curiosity_engine.py`: identify knowledge gaps, suggest learning/exploration.
12. **Experience replay** — `services/experience_replay.py`: review tool outcomes and reflections for planning heuristics.
13. **Personal knowledge graph** — `services/personal_knowledge_graph.py`: unified graph (timeline, projects, goals, identity); used during retrieval.

## Runtime optimization system

1. **Metrics** — `system_optimizer.collect_metrics()` aggregates from `resource_manager` (CPU, RAM, GPU) and `performance_monitor` (token throughput, tool latency, retrieval latency, agent decision time).
2. **Adaptive config** — `system_optimizer.get_effective_config(base_cfg)` returns merged config with runtime overrides when CPU/RAM/GPU exceed thresholds. `agent_loop` uses this at run start.
3. **Instrumentation** — Tool registry wraps each fn with timing; `log_tool_result` records to performance_monitor. `_llm_decision` timed; `log_agent_decision` records. Retrieval cache hit/miss records retrieval latency.
4. **Health/doctor** — `GET /health` and `GET /doctor` include `system_optimizer` summary (metrics, performance with averages and recent values, overrides, parallel_tasks_suggested).

---

## Capability evolution pipeline

1. **Discovery** — `capability_discovery.discover_candidate_libraries(capability_name)` fetches candidates from PyPI (`fetch_pypi_candidates`), GitHub (`fetch_github_candidates`), HuggingFace.
2. **Sandbox** — `integration_sandbox.evaluate_candidate()` creates temp venv, installs package, runs compatibility tests, benchmarks. Isolated from Layla runtime.
3. **Benchmark** — `benchmark_suite.run_benchmark()` measures latency, throughput, memory for vector_search, embedding, reranker, web_scraper. Results stored in `capability_implementations`.
4. **Promotion** — `capabilities/registry.get_active_implementation()` selects: 1) `runtime_config.capability_impls` override, 2) best benchmark score, 3) default.
